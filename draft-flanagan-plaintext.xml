    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>One of the requirements documented in <xref target="RFC6949">RFC 
      6949</xref>, "RFC Series Format Requirements and Future Development,"
      is the continued support for a plain text publication format.</t>

      <t>The Unicode Consortium defines 'plain text' as 
      <xref target="unicode-glossary">"Computer-encoded text that consists 
      only of a sequence of code points from a given standard, with no 
      other formatting or structural information.  Plain text interchange is 
      commonly used between computer systems that do not share higher-level 
      protocols."</xref></t>

      <t>While a plain text output for RFCs will continue to be required
      for the foreseeable future, the details of what that means for RFCs in 
      terms of which character encoding may be used, what the page layout 
      will look like, how to handle figures and artwork, and so on, are 
      documented in this draft.</t>

      <t>The following assumptions drive the changes in the plain text
      output for RFCs:</t>
          <t>
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>The existing tools to create the text file are extremely
              sensitive; manual manipulation is required in the final output.  
              In particular, handling page breaks for text is tricky.</t>
              <t>Additional publication formats--for example: PDF, HTML--
              will be available that will offer features such as markup, 
              pagination, etc. </t> 
            </list>
          </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Character Encoding">
      <t>The character encoding for all plain text documents will be 
      <xref target="RFC3629">UTF-8</xref>.  The file will include a byte order 
      mark (BOM) to provide text reader software with in-band information
      about the character encoding scheme used. </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Figures and Artwork">
      <t>Authors may continue to include figures drawn with ASCII characters.  
      If the canonical format includes figures or artwork other than ASCII-art,
      then the plain text output must include a pointer to the HTML version of
      the RFC to allow readers to see the relevant artwork.</t>
      <t>Authors who wish to include ASCII-art for the plain text file and 
      SVG art for the other outputs may do so, but they should be aware of the
      potential for confusion to individuals reading the RFC with two unique
      diagrams describing the same content.</t>
      <t>ASCII art will have a character width limit of no more than 85
      characters.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Page Layout">
      <t>Pagination is no longer required.  Line lengths for both text and
      artwork, will increase to 85 characters. </t>
        <section title="Headers and Footers">
          <t>The front matter on the front page (such as the RFC number 
          and category), and the back matter on the last page (the author's 
          full names and contact information) will continue with the 
          structure described in <xref target="RFC5741">RFC 5741</xref>, 
          "RFC Streams, Headers, and Boilerplates".  Given the removal of the 
          pagination requirement, running headers and footers will no 
          longer exist.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Table of Contents">
          <t>Given the removal of the pagination requirement, the Table of 
          Contents will list section and subsection numbers and titles, but 
          will not include page numbers.</t>
